Spreadsheets are a wonderful tool for gathering, viewing, sharing, and working with information. As with any tool, learning to use them effectively can make a big difference. In this tutorial we will discuss the structure of an effective spreadsheet, how to deal with certain tricky values you may work with, and some other tips and features for working with spreadsheets.

!!!! ## Learning Objectives
!!!!
!!!! - Describe the basic structure of a spreadsheet.
!!!! - Determine how to organize a complicated dataset.
!!!! - Avoid common pitfalls when creating tables or spreadsheets.
!!!! - Handle tricky information, like dates and null or unknown values.

## Basic Spreadsheet Structure

We will look at several sample spreadsheets to see how we can organize different types of information. Before we look at anything too complex, however, we need to define the basic "data structure" of a spreadsheet.

The Book Sample spreadsheet is a very basic example of standard table listing books.

!!! A quick note on terminology: I am using spreadsheet and table interchangeably here, since a well-organized spreadsheet is a table.

<table>
    <caption>Book Sample</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Author</th>
            <th>Date</th>
            <th>Publisher</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</td>
            <td>Edward R. Tufte</td>
            <td>1983</td>
            <td>Graphics Press</td>
        </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Why We Sleep</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>

There are three components of table structure that are important to note: Columns, rows, and cells.

A column lists some variable, or type of information. In this sample, that information includes title, author, date, and publisher. We could create more columns if we wanted to collect other information about the books - number of pages, ISBN number, subject, and so forth - anything you can think of that you would want to record.

A row lists one observation, or one "item" that we are observing. That "item" could be anything from an observation from hands-on research to information about a concept or physical object. Often, as is the case here, the first row provides column headers instead. This is important for making it clear what each column contains. In this sample, the items we are listing are books, so each row will contain one (and only one) book. This is one of the essential rules for organized spreadsheets: Each row contains information for only one object.

Each intersection of a row and column is a cell. A cell contains the value of the variable specified by the column for the item specified by the row. For example, the cell highlighted here contains the information specified by the Author for the observation of the third item - the book The Design of Everyday Things. In other words, this cell states that the author of The Design of Everyday Things is Don Norman.

The standard rule here is that there should only ever be one value per cell. While this sample conforms to the rule, there is a potential problem area in the author column. You are probably familiar with lots of books and articles that have more than one author. If I want to add a book with multiple authors to this spreadsheet, I have to choose between ignoring all authors other than the first, having multiple authors (values) in a single cell, or restructuring the sheet. As we will see, the last option is typically the best choice, although it will likely take more work. That is why it is important to plan out what information you have and how you will organize it early!

! ### Key Points
!
! - One value per cell
! - One item per row

Another fairly common attribute that shares the same difficulty as author is the tag attribute. Tweets, photographs, artifacts... all kinds of things can have any number of tags. In the next example, we will take a look at how we can address this kind of issue when it comes up.
