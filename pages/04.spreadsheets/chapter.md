Spreadsheets are a wonderful tool for gathering, viewing, sharing, and working with information. As with any tool, learning to use them effectively can make a big difference. In this tutorial we will discuss the structure of an effective spreadsheet, how to deal with certain tricky values you may work with, and some other tips and features for working with spreadsheets.

!! Learning Objectives
!!
!! - Describe the basic structure of a spreadsheet.
!! - Determine how to organize a complicated dataset.
!! - Avoid common pitfalls when creating tables or spreadsheets.
!! - Handle tricky information, like dates and null or unknown values.

## Spreadsheet Structure

We will look at several sample spreadsheets to see how we can organize different types of information. Before we look at anything too complex, however, we need to define the basic "data structure" of a spreadsheet.

The Book Sample spreadsheet is a very basic example of standard table listing books.

!!! A quick note on terminology: I am using spreadsheet and table interchangeably here, since a well-organized spreadsheet is a table.

<table>
    <caption>Book Sample</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Author</th>
            <th>Date</th>
            <th>Publisher</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</td>
            <td>Edward R. Tufte</td>
            <td>1983</td>
            <td>Graphics Press</td>
        </tr>
      <tr>

      <tr>
        <td>The Eye of the World</td>
        <td>Robert Jordan</td>
        <td>1990</td>
        <td>Tor Books</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Weapons of Math Destruction</td>
        <td>Cathy Oâ€™Neil</td>
        <td>2016</td>

There are three components of table structure that are important to note: Columns, rows, and cells.
