WAVE is an automated accessibility testing tool provided by WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind). While automated tools like WAVE will catch only a small to moderate percentage of errors, using one is a good first step in any testing process. WAVE is also a good tool if you can't do a full test but want to get a general overview of how accessible a page may be.

Whether you are doing a quick check with WAVE, using WAVE as the first step in a detailed testing process, or somewhere in between, this guide is for you.
